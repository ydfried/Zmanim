Zmanim Reminder Project

By: Suchy Fried & Levi Perelmuter 

This program will allow users to generate reminders for various halachic times throughout the day.

Reminders will be in the form of text messages and/or email. 

The project will implement publicly available libraries to implement the zmanim calculator and generate text messages.
