Zmanim Reminder Project

By: Suchy Fried & Levi Perelmuter 

This program will allow users to generate reminders for various halachic times throughout the day.

Reminders will be in the form of text messages. 

The project will use publically available libraries to implement the zmanim calculator and generate text messages.
