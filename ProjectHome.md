The _Zmanim_ (“times” referring to the calculations of time that govern the start and end time of Jewish prayers and holidays) project is a Java API for generating zmanim from within Java programs. If you are a non programmer, this means that the software created by the project is a building block of code to allow other programmers to easily include zmanim in their programs. The basis for most zmanim in this class are from the _sefer_ **Yisroel Vehazmanim** by **Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Harfenes**.

Ports of the KosherJava Zmanim API are available for both [.NET](https://github.com/Yitzchok/Zmanim) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/MosheBerman/KosherCocoa/).
